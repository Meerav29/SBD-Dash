## ðŸŒŒ Use Cases of the Small Body Dashboard

### ðŸ”­ 1. Understanding Object Size Distribution
- Visualize how diameter relates to absolute magnitude (H) and albedo.
- Estimate sizes of objects that only have brightness data.
- Useful for astronomers studying the population of small solar system bodies.

### ðŸª¨ 2. Planetary Defense & Risk Assessment
- NEOs (Near-Earth Objects) can be filtered and analyzed.
- Estimate object size to assess potential impact severity.
- Critical for early warning and disaster preparedness.

### ðŸ§ª 3. Model Testing and Educational Tool
- Compare linear, polynomial, and Bayesian models.
- Learn how transformations like `log10` improve fit.
- Ideal for teaching statistical modeling and validation methods.

### ðŸ“Š 4. Scientific Exploration & Pattern Discovery
- Interactive filters reveal trends in reflectivity and size.
- Identify clusters, outliers, or misclassified bodies.
- Support for hypothesis generation and future research directions.

## ðŸ“Œ Why It Matters
- Transforms a massive NASA dataset into an interactive, accessible dashboard.
- Helps users make informed decisions using modeling, visualization, and filtering.
- Applicable in astronomy, education, planetary defense, and data science.
