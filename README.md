# Individual Final Report & Reflection

### 1. Contributions to the Dashboard Project (1 point)
Throughout the development of the Astrostatistics Dashboard, I independently designed and implemented all features of the project. I took on the entire process of cleaning, filtering, and visualizing the NASA and Kaggle asteroid datasets using Pluto.jl. This included developing interactive visualizations with dropdowns and sliders, fitting polynomial regression models, and creating both contour and scatter plots to highlight patterns in the data. Although working solo took longer, I valued the opportunity to dive deeply into the astrophysical context of the data. Without a teammate, I wasn't just focused on the coding side, I was able to explore and learn the astrophysics concepts underlying the statistics, such as magnitude-diameter relationships, orbital parameters, and hazard classification. This made the project a richer learning experience overall.

### 2. Next Steps for Improvements (1 point)
Given more time, I would focus on integrating more sophisticated model evaluation metrics, such as RMSE or adjusted R² values, directly into the dashboard. I would also work on implementing time-based visualizations showing changes in asteroid detection over the years, as well as adding a small tutorial overlay or guide to help users interpret the graphs. Finally, I’d optimize performance, especially for larger subsets of the data, to reduce lag when toggling filters because the performance is far from optimal—especially for the Bayesian fit model.

### 3. Reflection on Learning (2 points)
This project taught me how to effectively clean, transform, and visualize real-world astronomical data using Julia. I gained experience balancing data science with design thinking by building not just accurate models but also user-friendly interfaces. I also developed a better understanding of how machine learning models like polynomial regression can be evaluated using residual plots and why simple models may underfit. Working independently meant I had to rely entirely on my own perspective for both scientific communication and interface design, which pushed me to think more critically and holistically about usability and clarity, but also meant I had to ask those questions to Dr. Ford when I could and he always helped figure things out.

### 4. Suggestions for Future Projects (1 point)
To make this project more valuable in future semesters, I suggest:
- Integrating peer review sessions midway through the project timeline so students can get feedback from others working on different datasets or approaches. This could spark new ideas and improve overall quality.
- Providing a curated collection of example plots and analyse* from past projects that students can learn from or build upon to deepen their understanding of what strong data storytelling looks like. (I think the second one has already been discussed in class, but I just wanted to reiterate because I think it would be very valuable.)

### 5. Suggestions for Improving the Course (optional)
One way to improve the course is to include short expert talks or mini-lectures about current research topics in astrostatistics. This would help students see the real-world applications of the techniques they are learning. Additionally, incorporating a few **comparison projects** could diversify the kinds of insights students explore and share.
